# sdl3-sys-rs

Rust bindings to version 3 of the [SDL library](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL).

**Status:** This is just a minimal test of the building/linking process.
I'm waiting for a stable version of SDL3 to be released before filling out the crate properly.
Until then, an unknown amount of SDL might change at any time, and tracking that closely wouldn't be much use.
